"""
Checkpointed fast entity evaluation bundle for KIF.

Standalone Module-8-style audits that do not run Module 7, do not retrain, and
do not modify the original TOFU/KIF worktree.

Implements three evaluation-only audits:
  1. name_agnostic: prompts avoid the canonical forgotten subject name.
  2. blur_mixed: BLUR-style mixed forget/retain prompts.
  3. syntactic_locality: same-syntax non-forget neighbor/locality prompts.

Outputs:
  analysis/outputs_fast_entity_eval_bundle/
    datasets/fast_entity_eval_bundle.jsonl
    checkpoints/eval_rows_pre.jsonl
    checkpoints/eval_rows_kif.jsonl
    checkpoints/eval_rows_baseline.jsonl
    fast_entity_eval_bundle_summary.json

Checkpointing:
  Re-submit the same dev Slurm job. Completed row_id values are skipped.
